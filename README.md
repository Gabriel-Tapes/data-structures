# Data Structures with java

This repository contains many implementations of data structures implemented with java.
I have made this repository to practice with Java and remember knowledge in data structures.

## What is data structures?

Programming Languages use many ways to storage data. The ways used for, is called "data structure". All programming languages have two ways to storage data in memory: primitive types and data structures. The primitive types, in general, are saved directely in memory, with a binary representation, so
they are numeric types in general.

In Java Language we have 8 primitive types: 
- byte
- char
- short
- int
- long 
- float
- double
- boolean
- void

On other hand, data structures are not saved directely, but by a reference. Instead of the value being saved directly, a memory address that points to the structure is saved. Data structures are the way to organize the primitive types or other data structures to optimize data writing, reading, sorting and etc. Depending on the situation a structure will be more used than others, which ones will be used must be defined by the developer in each case. The study of Data Structures is important to this, for the programmer to know when and why to use a given data structure.
